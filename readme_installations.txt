	3.3 Redo again step 3.2 for reinstalling PEAR. So that it will remove errors which is caused due to first time installation.
	3.4 a) Open your php.ini file which is located in C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.8 . Find
			/*	
				;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
				; Paths and Directories ;
				;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 


				; UNIX: "/path1:/path2"
				;include_path = ".:/php/includes"
				;
				; Windows: "\path1;\path2"
				;include_path = ".;c:\php\includes"
			*/
		b) Add include_path = ".;C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.8\pear"
		c) Now your file looks like
		   /*
				;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
				; Paths and Directories ;

				; UNIX: "/path1:/path2"
				;include_path = ".:/php/includes"

				;include_path = ".;c:\php\includes"
				include_path = ".;C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.8\pear"
	       */
		d) Save file, repeat same for php.ini in apache server, located at
			/*
				C:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.2.21\bin
			*/
			Note: Make sure to take a copy of .ini file before modification. Dont replace with file present inside php folder. Replacing may 
				  causes issues in future while working with apache server.
		e) Restart all services of WAMP server (especially PHP & Apache).
	3.5 Hurry! You have successfully finished PEAR installations. Now you are just 2 steps behind two complete this complete process.
	3.6 Dont close command prompt as it is required for further steps too.
4. The above PEAR installation doesnt comes with MAIL package. So we need to install MAIL package for PEAR. Follow below instructions to install 
   MAIL package.
   
	C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.8>pear install Mail-1.2.0 <<type this command and press enter>>
	
	This will install MAIL package. Along with MAIL package we need to install its dependency packages. Otherwise MAIL package will not work and 
	throws error while running PHP, when try using this MAIL package.
5. In order to install MAIL package dependencies, follow below instructions.
	
	5.1 Run below command in order to Net_SMTP-1.6.2. This contains two more dependencies. Generally those dependency files get installed during 
	    installation of Net_SMTP.
		
		C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.8>pear install Net_SMTP-1.6.2 <<type this command and press enter>>
		
	5.2 Run below command in order to install Net_SMTP dependency file Net_Socket. 
	
		C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.8>pear install Net_Socket-1.0.14 <<type this command and press enter>>
	
		If command prompt says that Net_Socket has been already installed then proceed with next step.
	
	5.3 Run below command in order to install Net_SMTP dependency file Auth_SASL. 
	
		C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.8>pear install Auth_SASL-1.0.6 <<type this command and press enter>>
	
		If command prompt says that Auth_SASL has been already installed then no issues, we will have complete installation of MAIL package.
		
	5.4 Hurry you have completed installation of MAIL package.

6. Restart WAMP server all services (especially PHP and Apache services).
7. Before running mail command or file make sure that below services are running.

	1. Apache-> Apache Modules -> ssl_module. If service is ticked then we can ensure that service is running otherwise click on the service name
	   in order to start the service.
	2. PHP -> PHP extensions -> php_openssl and php_sockets. If services are ticked then we can ensure that services are running otherwise click on the service name
	   in order to start the services.

8. CONGRATULATIONS!! YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED MAILING PROCESSES UNDER WAMP SERVER. TRY RUNNING BELOW SCRIPT WITH YOUR CREDENTIALS.
